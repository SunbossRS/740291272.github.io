THE CLOCK STOPPED TICKING FOREVER AGO

HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN UP? IDK :-(

I CAN'T GET A GRIP, BUT I CAN'T LET GO

THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO HOLD ON TO, THO


WHY CAN'T I SEE... WHY CAN'T I SEE...

ALL THE COLORS THAT YOU SEE..

PLEASE CAN I BE PLEASE CAN I BE

COLORFUL AND...free?


WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?! CAN SOMEONE TELL ME PLEASE--

WHY I'M SWITCHING FASTER THAN THE CHANNELS ON TV

I'M black THEN I'M white NO!!! SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT!!

MY ENEMY'S INVISIBLE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT

THE TREMBLING FEAR IS MORE THAN I CAN TAKE

WHEN I'M UP AGAINST THE ECHO IN THE MIRROR

ECHO


i'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black

i'm gonna run away now and never look back

i'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black

i'm gonna run away now and never look back

i'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black

i'm gonna run away now and never look back

i'm gonna burn my house down into an ugly black

i'm gonna run away now and never look back

i'm gonna burn my house down and never look back


and never look back


AND NEVER LOOK BACK


WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?! CAN SOMEONE TELL ME PLEASE--

WHY I'M SWITCHING FASTER THAN THE CHANNELS ON TV

I'M black THEN I'M white NO!!! SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT!!

MY ENEMY'S INVISIBLE, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIGHT
